**Welcome to My Website!**

Greetings and salutations! I'm Jianyan, a passionate software developer with a deep love for all things low-level programming. I am an alumnus of the Software Engineering program at the University of Waterloo, Ontario.

When I'm not busy crafting elegant lines of code, you'll find me buried in the captivating worlds of books or pushing my limits at the gym.

I've embarked on fascinating journeys, interning at Yugabyte and Wish, where I've contributed my skills as a software engineer. Now, I'm proud to be a part of the dynamic team at BlackBerry, where I continue to innovate and explore the limitless possibilities of software.

This virtual space is an extension of my passion and curiosity. Join me as we delve into the captivating realm of programming, share insights, and maybe even find some book and workout recommendations along the way.

Thank you for stepping into my world â€“ let's embark on this adventure together!

Warmest regards,

Jianyan
